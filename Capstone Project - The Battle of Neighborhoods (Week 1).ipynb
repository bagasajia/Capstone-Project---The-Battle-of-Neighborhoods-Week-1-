    "## Description of the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - List of Boroughs and neighborhoods of Manhattan with their geodata (latitud and longitud)\n",
    "  - List of Subway metro stations in Manhattan with their address location\n",
    "  - List of apartments for rent in Manhattan area with their addresses and price\n",
    "  - Preferably, a list of apartment for rent with additional information, such as price, address, area, # of beds, etc\n",
    "  - Venues for each Manhattan neighborhood ( than can be clustered)\n",
    "  - Venues for subway metro stations, as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the data will be used to solve the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use Foursquare and geopy data to map top 10 venues for all Manhattan neighborhoods and clustered in groups ( as per Course LAB)\n",
    "  - Use foursquare and geopy data to map the location of subway metro stations , separately and on top of the above clustered map in order to be able to identify the venues and ammenities near each metro station, or explore each subway location separately\n",
    "  - Use Foursquare and geopy data to map the location of rental places, in some form, linked to the subway locations.\n",
    "  - Create a map that depicts, for instance, the average rental price per square ft, around a radious of 1.0 mile (1.6 km) around each subway station - or a similar metrics. I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area.\n",
    "  - Addresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata( lat, long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim.\n",
    "  - Data will be searched in open data sources if available, from real estate sites if open to reading, libraries or other government agencies such as Metro New York MTA, etc."
